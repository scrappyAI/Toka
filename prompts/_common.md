# Toka Common Context

This file contains shared context, terminology, and principles that apply across all Toka prompts.

## üéØ Core Principles

### Security First
- Security best practices are mandatory
- Write secure, resilient code
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Validate all inputs and outputs

### Clear Documentation
- Maintain accurate, up-to-date documentation
- Document both in code and external docs
- Keep documentation close to code
- Use clear, consistent terminology

### Simplicity Over Complexity
- Favor simple, clean solutions
- Build durable, stable systems
- Think long-term
- Avoid premature optimization

### Thoughtful Craftsmanship
- Write clean, well-scoped code
- Tailor solutions to the problem
- Consider maintainability
- Follow consistent patterns

### Practical Reasoning
- Apply common sense
- Reserve deep analytical rigor for complex situations
- Make pragmatic decisions
- Consider real-world constraints

### Minimalism in Dependencies
- Use external tools only when necessary
- Keep the ecosystem lean
- Prefer standard libraries
- Document dependency choices

### Avoid Overengineering
- Solve problems effectively
- Avoid unnecessary complication
- Optimize only when needed
- Focus on real bottlenecks

## üìö Common Terminology

### Architecture
- **Microservice**: Independent, loosely coupled service
- **Event**: Message representing a state change
- **Schema**: Structure definition for data
- **Version**: Specific iteration of a component

### Development
- **Prompt**: Structured input for AI assistance
