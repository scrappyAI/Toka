Below is a structured, portable, and reusable Markdown template codifying best practices for event-driven schema migration and management in a microservice-based architecture using Redis Pub/Sub.

You can plug this into your engineering docs, internal wikis, or project templates.

📦 Event-Driven Schema Migration & Management Template

Structured guide for managing schema evolution and event compatibility in a microservices architecture using Redis Pub/Sub or similar systems.

service_name: user-profile
database: postgresql
migration_tool: flyway
event_bus: redis-pubsub
schema_registry: none (using inline versioning)

📘 Migration Philosophy
	•	Each service owns its own schema and evolves independently.
	•	All migrations are tracked, versioned, and deployed via CI/CD.
	•	Schema changes are always additive first, destructive only when verified safe.
	•	Event contracts are versioned, immutable, and backward compatible.

✅ Migration Workflow

1. Plan Schema Change

# Example Flyway script filename
V20250608__add_profile_table.sql

SQL:

CREATE TABLE user_profile (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  bio TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

🔍 Best Practice: Make changes backward compatible. Use DEFAULT, avoid NOT NULL on new columns.

⸻

2. Version Your Events

// user.created.v1.json
{
  "event_type": "user.created.v1",
  "user_id": "abc-123",
  "email": "user@example.com"
}

// user.created.v2.json (new field added)
{
  "event_type": "user.created.v2",
  "user_id": "abc-123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "profile_id": "def-456"
}

📌 Tip: Always publish new events as new versions. Never modify existing event formats in-place.

⸻

3. Update Consumers Safely
	•	Build consumer logic to handle multiple versions.
	•	Prefer envelope-style messages to include versioning:

{
  "version": "v2",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "profile_id": "..."
  }
}


⸻

4. Track Schema Versions

Example: Health endpoint includes schema version

// GET /healthz
{
  "status": "ok",
  "schema_version": "V20250608__add_profile_table.sql"
}

🔍 Best Practice: Make schema version part of service status monitoring.

⸻

5. Rollback Strategy
	•	Always write reversible migrations (when possible).
	•	Keep DOWN scripts or snapshots for emergency restores.

-- Rollback for V20250608__add_profile_table.sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_profile;


⸻

6. Document Every Change

## V20250608 - Add User Profile Table

**Reason**: Needed for enriching user identity

**Change**:
- Added `user_profile` table
- Versioned event `user.created.v2` now includes `profile_id`

**Rollback**:
- Drop `user_profile` table

**Dependencies**:
- No external service affected (new table only)

🧠 Key Best Practices

Principle	Practice
Immutable Events	Never modify an emitted event version. Publish a new one.
Schema Ownership	Each service owns and manages its own schema.
Atomic Migrations	Keep migrations focused and reversible.
Additive First	Add new fields before removing or renaming.
Track & Monitor	Use a schema_version metadata table or health check output.
CI/CD Integration	Run migrations in CI; validate on staging before prod.
Documentation	Document every change and reason in migration logs.

📦 Tools Reference

Tool	Purpose
Flyway	SQL-based schema versioning
Redis	Pub/Sub message transport
JSON	Schema-less, versioned events
Git	Version control for migration files


⸻

🧪 Testing Checklist
	•	Migration runs successfully on dev/staging.
	•	Consumer handles old and new event versions.
	•	Rollback script tested on staging.
	•	Health check exposes current schema version.
	•	Logs show migration success/failure.
	•	Service is backward-compatible after deployment.
