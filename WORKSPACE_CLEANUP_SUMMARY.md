## 🤖 Toka Agent Integration

### 1. Dependency Graph Analyzer Agent
```toml
Name: dependency-graph-analyzer
Domain: code-analysis
Priority: high
Capabilities: rust-workspace-analysis, dependency-graph-visualization, 
              agent-composition-analysis, architecture-visualization
```

### 2. Date Enforcement Validator Agent
```toml
Name: date-enforcement-validator
Domain: quality-assurance
Priority: critical
Capabilities: date-validation, date-correction, template-processing,
              compliance-checking, automated-date-insertion
```

### 3. System Monitoring Agent
```toml
Name: system-monitoring-agent
Domain: operations
Priority: high
Capabilities: raft-cluster-monitoring, performance-metrics-collection,
              system-health-monitoring, alert-generation
```

## 🔧 Tools Created

### Date Enforcement Tools
- **`scripts/validate_dates.py`** - Validates dates across all workspace files
- **`scripts/insert_date.sh`** - Processes date templates with current dates
- **Integration**: Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD validation

### Agent Specifications
- **`agents/tools/dependency_graph_agent.toml`** - Dependency analysis agent
- **`agents/tools/date_enforcement_agent.toml`** - Date validation agent
- **`agents/tools/monitoring_agent.toml`** - System monitoring agent

## 📈 Architectural Improvements Identified

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Resolve circular dependency** between `toka-agent-runtime` and `toka-orchestration`
2. **Create shared abstraction layer** (`toka-agent-core`)
3. **Implement event-driven communication** via `toka-bus-core`

### Strategic Improvements
1. **Storage Strategy Pattern** - Coordinate multiple storage backends
2. **Agent Plugin System** - Make agent types pluggable
3. **Security Policy Coordinator** - Unify security architecture
4. **Performance Optimization** - Lazy loading and crate consolidation

### Architecture Strengths Confirmed
- ✅ **Clear layered architecture** with 7 distinct layers
- ✅ **Plugin-based design** for storage and security
- ✅ **Async-first architecture** with proper error handling
- ✅ **Workspace management** with unified versioning

## 🎯 Implementation Standards

### Date Enforcement Standards
```markdown
✅ Use 2025-07-06 for current date placeholders
✅ Use 2025-07-06 for release/commit dates
✅ Use <!-- DATE:EXEMPT source="reference" --> for historical dates
✅ Run scripts/validate_dates.py before commits
```

### Documentation Standards
```markdown
✅ Include status indicators (Draft, Stable, Deprecated)
✅ Use consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
✅ Link to related documents
✅ Update master index when adding documents
```

### Agent Integration Standards
```markdown
✅ Follow TOML agent specification format
✅ Include capability tokens for security
✅ Specify resource limits and sandboxing
✅ Define clear command interfaces
```

## 🔄 Maintenance Workflows

### Automated Workflows
1. **Daily date validation** via date-enforcement-validator agent
2. **Weekly dependency analysis** via dependency-graph-analyzer agent
3. **Continuous monitoring** via system-monitoring-agent
4. **Monthly documentation review** via agent-scheduled tasks

### Manual Workflows
1. **Quarterly architecture review** using architectural analysis report
2. **Semi-annual tool agent evaluation** and optimization
3. **Annual cleanup assessment** and standards update
