## Technical Implementation Details

### Schema Compliance
All agent specifications follow the canonical schema defined in `.cursor/schemas/agent-spec-schema.yaml` with complete validation:

- ✅ Metadata validation (kebab-case names, version format, branch patterns)
- ✅ Capability validation (primary/secondary limits, format checking)
- ✅ Security validation (resource limits, capability requirements)
- ✅ Dependency validation (required/optional dependencies)
- ✅ Behavioral directive validation
- ✅ Risk mitigation validation
- ✅ Success criteria validation

### Integration Points
- **Tool Registry:** Agents register their capabilities as tools
- **Orchestration:** Integration with `toka-orchestration` crate for workstream management
- **Validation:** Schema validation against canonical specification
- **Behavioral Management:** Dynamic behavioral adaptation based on context
- **Risk Assessment:** Automated risk identification and mitigation strategies

### Dynamic Composability
The new system enables:
- **Template-based Creation:** Agents can be created from templates with custom configurations
- **Runtime Composition:** Dynamic agent specification building with validation
- **Capability Extension:** Agents can be extended with additional capabilities
- **Contextual Adaptation:** Behavioral directives adapt to environment and priority
