# Toka OS v0.3 Enhancement Roadmap
**Version:** 0.3.0 â€“ 2025-07-04  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Research Base:** [20250703_231515_workspace_report.md](../research/20250703_231515_workspace_report.md)  
**Target:** Non-breaking enhancements to v0.2.1 architecture

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a systematic enhancement roadmap for Toka OS v0.3, derived from comprehensive codebase research. The focus is on **non-breaking improvements** that can be developed in parallel across six domain-specific workstreams:

1. **Build System Stabilization** (Critical Path)
2. **Testing Infrastructure Expansion** 
3. **Kernel Event Model Enhancement**
4. **Storage Layer Advancement**
5. **Security Framework Extension**
6. **Performance & Observability Foundation**

All enhancements maintain backward compatibility with existing v0.2.1 APIs while providing additive capabilities for future evolution.
