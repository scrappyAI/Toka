# Protocol Reference

This folder houses **local guidance** for keeping the Toka workspace aligned
with the two open-standards we target:

| Protocol | Scope | Upstream Spec |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) | LLM â‡„ *tool / context* interactions | <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26> |
| **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent) | Cross-vendor agent collaboration | <https://google.github.io/A2A/> |

Read the dedicated sub-pages for implementation check-lists, version mapping
and local deviations:

* [`mcp_rust.md`](mcp_rust.md)
* [`a2a_google.md`](a2a_google.md)
