## LLM Integration Setup Guide

### Quick Setup

For Anthropic Claude (Recommended):
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
export LLM_PROVIDER="anthropic"
```

For OpenAI GPT-4:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export LLM_PROVIDER="openai"
```

### Advanced Configuration

```bash
export LLM_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"  # or "gpt-4"
export LLM_RATE_LIMIT="60"  # requests per minute
export LLM_TIMEOUT="30"     # timeout in seconds
export LLM_DEBUG="false"    # enable debug logging
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Local Development:** Use `.env` file with `.gitignore` protection
2. **CI/CD:** Use GitHub Secrets for credential storage
3. **Production:** Environment variable injection
4. **Rotation:** Monthly API key rotation recommended

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Example

```rust
use toka_orchestration::{OrchestrationEngine, OrchestrationConfig};
use toka_llm_gateway::{Config as LlmConfig, LlmGateway};
use toka_runtime::{Runtime, RuntimeConfig};
use std::sync::Arc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Load agent configurations
    let config = OrchestrationConfig::from_directory("agents/v0.3.0/workstreams")?;
    
    // Initialize Toka runtime
    let runtime = Arc::new(Runtime::new(
        RuntimeConfig::default(),
        Arc::new(your_token_validator),
    ).await?);
    
    // Configure LLM integration
    let llm_config = LlmConfig::from_env()?;
    let llm_gateway = Arc::new(LlmGateway::new(llm_config).await?);
    
    // Create orchestration engine with LLM intelligence
    let engine = Arc::new(
        OrchestrationEngine::new(config, runtime)
            .await?
            .with_llm_gateway(llm_gateway)
    );
    
    // Start multi-agent orchestration
    let session = engine.start_orchestration().await?;
    session.wait_for_completion().await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```
