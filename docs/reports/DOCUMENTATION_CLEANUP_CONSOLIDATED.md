## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive documentation cleanup and reorganization performed on the Toka OS repository. The cleanup focused on removing scattered root-level documentation, eliminating duplicates, and creating a properly organized documentation structure.

## 📋 Cleanup Objectives

All primary cleanup objectives have been achieved:

- ✅ **Moved scattered root-level documentation** to proper subdirectories
- ✅ **Eliminated duplicate documentation files** 
- ✅ **Created logical directory structure** for guides and reports
- ✅ **Updated cross-references** and fixed broken links
- ✅ **Improved navigation** through better organization
- ✅ **Maintained date accuracy** according to project standards

## 🗂️ Files Moved and Reorganized

### Root-Level Documentation Moved to docs/guides/
- `AGENT_RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` → `docs/guides/AGENT_RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

### Root-Level Documentation Moved to docs/reports/
- `RAFT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/reports/RAFT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/reports/agent_runtime_implementation_summary.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md` → `docs/reports/IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md`
