**Version**: v0.3.0  
**Focus**: Agent Orchestration Memory & Context Management

---

## Executive Summary

The Toka system implements a sophisticated multi-layered memory and context management architecture designed to maintain coherence across concurrent agent operations. The system employs multiple complementary mechanisms for state persistence, context caching, and coordination to ensure system reliability and performance at scale.

## System Architecture Overview

The Toka system consists of several key components that work together to manage memory and context:

1. **Storage Layer** - Pluggable backends for persistent state
2. **Agent Runtime** - Context management for individual agents  
3. **Orchestration Engine** - Coordination and coherence across agents
4. **LLM Integration** - Context caching for AI interactions
5. **Kernel Bus** - Event-driven communication and state updates

## Memory and Context Management Components

### 1. Storage Layer Architecture

The storage layer provides the foundation for all persistence in the Toka system through a pluggable backend architecture:

#### Core Storage Abstraction (`toka-store-core`)

- **Event-Sourced Architecture**: All state changes are captured as immutable events with causal ordering
- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**: Provides durability guarantees and crash recovery
- **Content Deduplication**: Payloads are deduplicated by Blake3 content hash
- **Semantic Analysis Framework**: Plugin-based system for intelligent content analysis

```rust
pub trait StorageBackend: Send + Sync {
    async fn commit(&self, header: &EventHeader, payload: &[u8]) -> Result<()>;
    async fn header(&self, id: &EventId) -> Result<Option<EventHeader>>;
    async fn payload_bytes(&self, digest: &CausalDigest) -> Result<Option<Vec<u8>>>;
}

pub trait WriteAheadLog: Send + Sync {
    async fn begin_transaction(&self) -> Result<TransactionId>;
    async fn write_entry(&self, transaction_id: TransactionId, operation: WalOperation) -> Result<()>;
    async fn commit_transaction(&self, transaction_id: TransactionId) -> Result<()>;
    async fn recover(&self) -> Result<WalRecoveryResult>;
}
```

#### Storage Backend Implementations

**In-Memory Storage (`toka-store-memory`)**:
- Fast, non-persistent storage using HashMap collections
- Real-time event streaming via broadcast channels
- WAL support for testing and API consistency
- Context isolation through Arc<RwLock<>> patterns

**SQLite Storage (`toka-store-sqlite`)**:
- ACID-compliant persistence with SQLite WAL mode
- Schema versioning and automatic migrations
- Efficient indexing for event queries
- Transaction-based consistency guarantees

**Key Features**:
- **Causal Consistency**: Events maintain cryptographic causal ordering via Blake3 hashes
- **Crash Recovery**: WAL replay ensures system can recover to consistent state
- **Content Addressable**: Payloads stored by content hash enable deduplication

### 2. Agent Context Management

Each agent maintains isolated execution context while participating in system-wide coordination:

#### Agent Context Structure

```rust
pub struct AgentContext {
    pub agent_id: EntityId,
    pub config: AgentConfig,
    pub state: AgentExecutionState,
    pub started_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub last_activity: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub metrics: AgentMetrics,
    pub environment: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

#### Context Isolation and Management

- **Process-Level Isolation**: Each agent runs in separate Tokio task with controlled resource limits
- **State Tracking**: Comprehensive execution state management (Initializing → Ready → ExecutingTask → Completed)
- **Metrics Collection**: Real-time performance and resource usage tracking
- **Environment Management**: Agent-specific environment variables and context

### 3. LLM Context Management

The system provides sophisticated context caching and management for Large Language Model interactions:

#### Agent LLM Context Structure

```rust
pub struct AgentLlmContext {
    pub agent_name: String,
    pub workstream: String,
    pub current_task: Option<String>,
    pub task_history: Vec<TaskExecutionRecord>,
    pub prompt_context: String,
    pub last_interaction: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub usage_stats: AgentLlmStats,
}
```

#### Context Caching Strategy

- **Rolling Task History**: Maintains last 10 task executions for context continuity
- **Agent-Specific Prompts**: Tailored prompt contexts based on agent capabilities and domain
- **Usage Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics on LLM token consumption and performance
- **Context Templating**: Domain-specific prompt templates for different agent types

#### Cache Configuration

```toml
[caching]
context_cache_size = 2048
context_cache_ttl = 7200  # 2 hours
response_cache_enabled = true
response_cache_size = 1024
response_cache_ttl = 3600  # 1 hour
```

### 4. Orchestration Engine State Management

The orchestration engine maintains global coordination state across all agents:

#### Session State Management

```rust
pub struct SessionState {
    pub session_id: String,
    pub started_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub current_phase: OrchestrationPhase,
    pub progress: f64,
    pub completed: bool,
    pub error: Option<String>,
}
```

#### Agent State Coordination

- **Concurrent State Tracking**: DashMap-based concurrent access to agent states
- **Phase-Based Orchestration**: Sequential phases with dependency resolution
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking across all agents
- **Event-Driven Updates**: State changes propagated via kernel events

### 5. System Coherence Mechanisms

#### Dependency Resolution

The system maintains coherence through sophisticated dependency management:

```rust
pub struct DependencyResolver {
    dependencies: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
    dependency_graph: HashMap<String, HashSet<String>>,
}
```

**Dependency Types**:
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Critical infrastructure must complete before foundation services
- **Workstream Dependencies**: Cross-workstream coordination requirements  
- **Resource Dependencies**: Shared resource access coordination

#### Event-Driven Coordination

The kernel bus provides the primary coordination mechanism:

- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes captured as events
- **Causal Ordering**: Events maintain partial ordering for consistency
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate propagation of state changes
- **Error Propagation**: Failure handling and recovery coordination

#### Concurrency Control

- **Arc<RwLock<>>**: Reader-writer locks for shared state access
- **DashMap**: Lock-free concurrent HashMap for high-performance access
- **Atomic Operations**: Lock-free counters and flags where appropriate
- **Message Passing**: Tokio channels for inter-component communication

## Configuration and Tuning

### Resource Limits

```toml
[security.resource_limits]
max_memory = "512MB"
max_cpu = "0.5"
timeout = "1800"

[orchestration]
max_concurrent_agents = 8
agent_spawn_timeout = 30
workstream_timeout = 3600
agent_pool_size = 10
```

### Performance Optimization

```toml
[monitoring]
metrics_enabled = true
tracing_enabled = true
log_level = "info"

[caching]
context_cache_size = 2048
context_cache_ttl = 7200
```

## System Coherence Strategies

### 1. Sequential Phase Orchestration

The system maintains coherence through carefully orchestrated phases:

1. **Critical Infrastructure**: Sequential spawning of critical agents
2. **Foundation Services**: Dependency-based spawning order
3. **Parallel Development**: Concurrent execution with coordination
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking and error handling
5. **Completion**: Graceful shutdown and cleanup

### 2. State Synchronization

- **Atomic Updates**: State changes are atomic at the agent level
- **Event Ordering**: Causal consistency through event ordering
- **Checkpoint Recovery**: WAL-based recovery ensures consistency after failures
- **Distributed State**: Coordination across multiple agent processes

### 3. Error Handling and Recovery

```rust
// Agent failure recovery based on priority
match agent_info.priority {
    AgentPriority::Critical => {
        suspend_dependent_agents(failed_agent).await?;
        restart_critical_agent(failed_agent, agent_info).await?;
    }
    AgentPriority::High | AgentPriority::Medium => {
        log_agent_failure(failed_agent, reason).await?;
        reassign_failed_tasks(failed_agent).await?;
    }
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage Patterns

- **Event Storage**: Content-addressed with deduplication
