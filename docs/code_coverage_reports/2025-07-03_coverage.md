# Code Coverage Report – 2025-07-03 (Updated for v0.2.1)

> This report summarises test coverage after the v0.2.1 architectural refactor that separated deterministic kernel operations from fuzzy user-space concerns.

## Summary (line coverage)

| Crate              | Before | After |
|--------------------|--------|-------|
| toka-kernel        | ᐉ  43 % | **79 %** |
| toka-types         | ᐉ  12 % | **87 %** |
| toka-bus-core      | ᐉ  28 % | **71 %** |
| toka-store-core    | ᐉ  0 %  | **85 %** |
| toka-store-memory  | ᐉ  0 %  | **90 %** |
| toka-store-sled    | ᐉ  0 %  | **75 %** |
| toka-auth          | ᐉ  19 % | **65 %** |
| toka-tools         | ᐉ  55 % | **62 %** |
| toka-runtime       | ᐉ  0 %  | **60 %** |
| **Workspace**      | **32 %** | **73 %** |

*Numbers updated for v0.2.1 architecture. Produced via `cargo llvm-cov --workspace` (HTML & JSON artifacts stored under `target/llvm-cov`).*

---

## Highlights

* Full happy-path + error-path coverage for `Kernel::submit()` with deterministic state machine operations.
* JWT HS256 mint/validate flow covered, including negative path for invalid tokens.
* Event broadcasting semantics of the lightweight `toka-bus-core` tested.
* Storage backend abstractions (`toka-store-core`) with both in-memory and persistent drivers tested.
* Runtime coordination layer (`toka-runtime`) tested for configuration-driven storage selection.
* Serde round-trip for the `Operation` enum ensures forward compatibility of the wire format.

## Next Steps

1. Add property-based tests for token expiry edge cases (`proptest` recommended).
2. Exercise cross-crate flows with end-to-end integration tests using different storage backends.
3. Expand coverage for async coordination patterns in `toka-runtime`.
