### Flow Analysis
This function exhibits moderate complexity, async operations, comprehensive error handling, conditional logic.

## Architecture Notes
• **Processor/Handler**: Core business logic execution
• **Async Pattern**: Uses async/await for authentication operations
• **Error Resilience**: Multiple error handling strategies
• **Validation Logic**: Input validation with early returns

## LLM Context for Architecture Understanding

This function represents a typical async request handler in the Toka system:

1. **Entry Flow**: Validates incoming requests with early error handling
2. **Authentication**: Async authentication with proper error propagation
3. **Processing**: Core business logic with error boundaries
4. **Response**: Structured response formatting
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management throughout the flow

The moderate complexity (cyclomatic: 8) indicates well-structured code with appropriate branching. The async complexity (3) shows thoughtful async coordination without over-complication. The error handling complexity (5) demonstrates robust error management patterns.

**Architectural Significance**: This pattern is likely replicated across similar handlers in the system, making it a good example of the request processing architecture.
