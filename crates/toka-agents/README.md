# toka-agents

Toka Agents â€“ default agent implementations

This crate provides out-of-the-box agents (e.g. `SymbolicAgent`) that can be compiled
into `toka-runtime` when the `agents-core` feature is enabled.  The implementation is
intentionally free of heavy external dependencies so the runtime can remain lean.
