extends: ["CoreBaseline", "SecurityBase"]

objectives:
  - "Prevent unauthorized or irreversible agent actions"
  - "Constrain agents within observable environments"
  - "Prevent prompt injection and capability escalation"

agent_constraints:
  capabilities:
    - "All agents must declare capabilities explicitly"
    - "Disallow dynamic tool access unless authorized"
    - "Prefer capability-based over natural language interfaces"
  
  sandboxing:
    requirements:
      - "Run in isolated environments (WASM, Docker, virtual VFS)"
      - "Log inputs and outputs deterministically"
      - "Enforce timeouts and memory limits"
      - "Disable network/filesystem unless scoped"
  
  input_hardening:
    - "Sanitize all user input before LLM forwarding"
    - "Detect prompt injection patterns"
    - "Use structured schemas for critical actions"
    - "Validate against instruction leakage"

logging_requirements:
  mandatory_fields:
    - "original_intent"
    - "tools_invoked"
    - "outcome_status"
    - "failure_state" # if applicable
  
  storage:
    - "Use tamper-evident formats for critical actions"
    - "Include timestamps and agent IDs"
    - "Audit trail for financial/security operations"

policy_enforcement:
  runtime_policies:
    - "Define constraints per invocation layer"
    - "Use static rules for high-risk actions (DELETE, TRANSFER, EXEC)"
    - "Dynamic evaluation for context-sensitive decisions"
  
  memory_safety:
    - "Agent memory ephemeral by default"
    - "Namespace by agent ID and purpose"
    - "Include timestamps and access reasons"

fail_safe_defaults:
  - "Fail closed when in doubt"
  - "Elevated actions require human approval"
  - "Avoid speculative or irreversible actions"
  - "Use confirmation rounds for critical operations"

tool_constraints:
  registration:
    - "Central manifest with ID, version, capability"
    - "Deny runtime-discovered tools"
    - "Require authorization for privileged tools"
  
  isolation:
    - "Subprocess/network tools in sandboxes"
    - "Mark privileged tools explicitly"
    - "Emit audit logs with trace IDs"
