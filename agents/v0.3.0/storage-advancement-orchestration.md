   - Configurable enforcement (warn or reject)
   - Maintain referential integrity

3. **Business Rule Validation**
   - Pluggable validation logic system
   - Custom validation rule framework
   - Integration with existing validation patterns

### Phase 4: Concurrency Enhancement (Week 4)

   - Entity version numbers with conflict resolution
   - Automatic retry mechanisms
   - Deadlock detection and prevention

2. **Batch Operations**
   - Transaction batching with rollback on failure
   - Improved throughput for bulk operations
   - Configurable batch sizes

3. **Read Replicas**
   - Eventually consistent read-only replicas
   - Configurable lag tolerance
   - Automatic failover mechanisms

## Technical Architecture

### Storage Backend Abstraction
```rust
pub trait WriteAheadLog {
    type TransactionId;
    type LogEntry;
    
    fn begin_transaction(&mut self) -> Result<Self::TransactionId>;
    fn write_entry(&mut self, tx_id: Self::TransactionId, entry: Self::LogEntry) -> Result<()>;
    fn commit(&mut self, tx_id: Self::TransactionId) -> Result<()>;
    fn rollback(&mut self, tx_id: Self::TransactionId) -> Result<()>;
    fn recover(&mut self) -> Result<Vec<Self::LogEntry>>;
}
```

### Semantic Analysis Plugin Interface
```rust
pub trait SemanticAnalysisPlugin {
    type Input;
    type Output;
    
    fn analyze(&self, input: Self::Input) -> Result<Self::Output>;
    fn plugin_id(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn plugin_version(&self) -> &'static str;
}
```

### Schema Validation Framework
```rust
pub trait SchemaValidator {
    type Data;
    type ValidationResult;
    
    fn validate(&self, data: &Self::Data) -> Self::ValidationResult;
    fn validation_rules(&self) -> &[ValidationRule];
}
```
