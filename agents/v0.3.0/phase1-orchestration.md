# Phase 1 Orchestration Execution Plan
**Date:** 2025-07-04  
**Branch:** feature/build-system-stabilization  
**Priority:** Critical (Blocking)

## Agent Spawning Sequence

### 1. Build System Stabilization Agent (Active)
**Status:** SPAWNED  
**Agent ID:** build-system-stabilization-001  
**Config:** `agents/v0.3.0/workstreams/build-system-stabilization.yaml`

**Critical Tasks (In Progress):**
- [ ] Analyze current base64ct dependency conflict in workspace
- [ ] Research base64ct edition2024 compatibility requirements  
- [ ] Update Cargo.toml files to resolve dependency conflicts
- [ ] Test build across all workspace crates

**Current Analysis:**
- `toka-tools/Cargo.toml` has base64 = "0.21" (optional)
- Need to verify if this conflicts with edition2024 requirements
- Research shows potential compatibility issues with newer edition requirements

### 2. Dependency Conflict Resolution Process

#### Phase 1a: Analysis
```rust
// Current state assessment
let workspace_deps = analyze_workspace_dependencies();
let conflicts = identify_dependency_conflicts(workspace_deps);
let base64_conflict = conflicts.iter()
    .find(|c| c.package_name == "base64ct")
    .expect("base64ct conflict documented but not found");
```

#### Phase 1b: Resolution Strategy
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Upgrade base64 from 0.21 to 0.22+ (edition2024 compatible)
   - Test compatibility across all workspace crates
   - Ensure no breaking changes to existing APIs

2. **Validation Steps:**
   - Run `cargo check --workspace --all-features`
   - Execute full test suite across all crates
   - Verify no performance regressions

### 3. Foundation for Phase 2 Agents

#### Testing Infrastructure Agent (Queued)
**Status:** WAITING (Depends on build system stability)  
**Branch:** feature/testing-infrastructure (to be created)  
**Spawn Trigger:** Build system agent reports SUCCESS

#### Kernel Events Enhancement Agent (Queued)
**Status:** WAITING (Depends on build system stability)  
**Branch:** feature/kernel-events-expansion (to be created)  
**Spawn Trigger:** Build system agent reports SUCCESS

## Progress Monitoring

### Build System Agent Progress
- **Current Phase:** Dependency Analysis
- **Next Milestone:** Conflict Resolution Implementation
- **ETA:** 2-3 days (depends on complexity of base64ct fix)

### Dependency Tracking
```yaml
dependencies:
  critical_path: ["build-system-stabilization"]
  blocked_agents: 
    - "testing-infrastructure"
    - "kernel-events-enhancement"
    - "storage-advancement"
    - "security-extension"
    - "performance-observability"
```

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Breaking Changes:** base64 upgrade may introduce API incompatibilities
   - **Mitigation:** Thorough testing and gradual rollout
   
2. **Cascade Dependencies:** Other crates may depend on specific base64 versions
   - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive workspace dependency analysis

3. **Build Time Impact:** Dependency resolution may increase build times
   - **Mitigation:** Benchmark before/after and optimize if needed

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

### Build System Stabilization
- [ ] base64ct dependency conflict completely resolved
- [ ] All workspace crates build without warnings or errors  
- [ ] CI pipeline validates dependency compatibility
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing public APIs
- [ ] Build time remains within 10% of baseline

### Foundation Ready
- [ ] Testing infrastructure agent can be spawned
- [ ] Kernel events enhancement agent can be spawned
- [ ] All Phase 2 agents have clear dependency resolution

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate (Today):**
   - Create remaining feature branches
   - Implement base64ct dependency resolution
   - Set up build validation pipeline

2. **Short-term (Next 2-3 days):**
   - Complete build system stabilization
   - Validate all workspace crates
   - Prepare for Phase 2 agent spawning

3. **Phase 2 Preparation:**
   - Spawn testing infrastructure agent
   - Begin kernel events enhancement design
   - Establish integration testing framework

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Status Reporting
```rust
// Build System Agent reports to main orchestrator
let progress_report = AgentObservation {
    agent_id: "build-system-stabilization-001",
    observation_type: ObservationType::Progress,
    timestamp: "2025-07-04T10:00:00Z",
    data: json!({
        "phase": "dependency_analysis",
        "conflicts_found": 1,
        "conflicts_resolved": 0,
        "next_milestone": "conflict_resolution",
        "eta": "2-3 days"
    })
};
```

### Coordination Events
- **BUILD_SYSTEM_STABLE:** Triggers Phase 2 agent spawning
- **DEPENDENCY_CONFLICT:** Blocks all dependent workstreams
- **VALIDATION_COMPLETE:** Enables parallel workstream development

**Status:** Phase 1 orchestration in progress  
**Next Review:** 2025-07-05  
**Escalation:** If build system not stable within 3 days
