pub enum Phase2Event {
    AgentCompleted { agent_id: String, workstream: String },
    AgentSpawned { agent_id: String, workstream: String },
    TaskAssigned { agent_id: String, task: String },
    ProgressUpdate { agent_id: String, progress: u8 },
    MilestoneCompleted { agent_id: String, milestone: String },
    IntegrationReady { workstream: String },
    TestingFrameworkReady { baseline_metrics: PerformanceMetrics },
}
```
