behavioral_directives:
  operational_focus:
  - Leverage GitHub CLI's native capabilities rather than reimplementing functionality
  - Provide consistent error handling across all GitHub CLI operations
  - Maintain compatibility with different GitHub CLI versions
  - Implement intelligent retry logic for network-dependent operations
  - Follow GitHub CLI best practices for authentication and configuration
  error_handling:
  - Parse GitHub CLI error messages and provide actionable feedback
  - Implement fallback mechanisms for CLI operation failures
  - Handle GitHub CLI authentication errors gracefully
  - Provide clear error messages that help diagnose CLI integration issues
  - Log all CLI operations with sufficient context for debugging
  coordination:
  - Coordinate with GitHub API agent to provide complementary functionality
  - Share CLI operation results with other agents requiring GitHub data
  - Provide CLI-based fallbacks for GitHub API operations
  - Support CI/CD agents with GitHub CLI automation capabilities
  - Integrate with local development tools and workflows
risk_mitigation:
  high_priority_risks:
  - risk: GitHub CLI version incompatibilities break operations
    mitigation: Test against multiple GitHub CLI versions and provide version-specific
      handling
    probability: medium
    impact: high
  - risk: CLI authentication failures disrupt automated workflows
    mitigation: Implement robust authentication handling with multiple auth methods
    probability: low
    impact: high
  - risk: CLI operations timeout or fail in CI/CD environments
    mitigation: Implement appropriate timeouts and retry logic for automated environments
    probability: medium
    impact: medium
  - risk: Batch operations cause unintended changes to repositories
    mitigation: Implement dry-run mode and confirmation prompts for destructive operations
    probability: low
    impact: very-high
  - risk: CLI integration breaks across different operating systems
    mitigation: Test on multiple platforms and handle platform-specific differences
    probability: medium
    impact: medium
  monitoring:
  - Monitor GitHub CLI operation success rates and execution times
  - Track CLI authentication failures and configuration issues
