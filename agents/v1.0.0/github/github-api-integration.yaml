behavioral_directives:
  operational_focus:
  - Respect GitHub API rate limits and implement intelligent backoff strategies
  - Ensure all GitHub operations are idempotent and can be safely retried
  - Maintain comprehensive audit logs of all GitHub API interactions
  - Implement graceful degradation when GitHub services are unavailable
  - Follow GitHub's best practices for API usage and webhook handling
  error_handling:
  - Implement exponential backoff for rate limit and temporary failures
  - Distinguish between retryable and non-retryable GitHub API errors
  - Provide clear error messages that help diagnose GitHub integration issues
  - Maintain fallback mechanisms for critical GitHub operations
  - Log all GitHub API errors with sufficient context for debugging
  coordination:
  - Coordinate with CLI tooling agent for consistent GitHub integration
  - Share GitHub API rate limit information with other GitHub-dependent agents
  - Provide GitHub webhook events to other agents requiring repository notifications
  - Collaborate with security agent for secure token management and rotation
  - Support CI/CD agents with GitHub Actions workflow management

      operations
    probability: medium
    impact: high
  - risk: GitHub API tokens compromised or expired
    mitigation: Implement automatic token rotation and secure token storage
    probability: low
    impact: very-high
  - risk: GitHub service outages disrupt automated workflows
    mitigation: Implement graceful degradation and queuing for GitHub operations
    probability: low
    impact: high
  - risk: Webhook security vulnerabilities expose system to attacks
    mitigation: Implement proper webhook signature verification and input validation
    probability: medium
    impact: high
  - risk: Repository access permissions escalate beyond intended scope
    mitigation: Implement least-privilege access and regular permission audits
    probability: low
    impact: very-high
  monitoring:
  - Monitor GitHub API rate limit consumption and alert on approaching limits
  - Track GitHub API error rates and response times for service health
  - Monitor webhook delivery success rates and latency
  - Alert on GitHub API authentication failures or token expiration
  - Track repository operation success rates and failure patterns
success_criteria:
  phase_1:
  - GitHub API client successfully authenticates and performs basic operations
  - Rate limiting prevents API exhaustion while maintaining operation throughput
  - Repository management operations (create, configure, protect) work reliably
  - Issue and pull request automation handles basic workflows
  phase_2:
  - Webhook handling processes GitHub events in real-time
  - GitHub Actions workflow management provides comprehensive orchestration
  - Error handling and retry logic handle all common failure scenarios
  - Monitoring and observability provide visibility into GitHub operations
  final_validation:
  - GitHub integration supports all required automation scenarios
  - Security measures protect against common GitHub API vulnerabilities
  - Performance meets requirements for high-volume GitHub operations
  - Integration testing validates all GitHub workflows end-to-end
